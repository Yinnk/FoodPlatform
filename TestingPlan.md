# Testing Plan

## 1. Types of Testing

### 1.1 Unit Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify individual functions or components in isolation to ensure they work correctly.  
- **Automated/Manual**: Automated  
- **Tools**: Jest or other relevant testing frameworks for JavaScript/React.  
- **Scope**: Focuses on small code units (e.g., functions, methods).  

### 1.2 Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Ensure that different modules or services interact as expected.  
- **Automated/Manual**: Manual  
- **Tools**: Cypress, Supertest, or similar tools for API testing.  
- **Scope**: Test how multiple components work together (e.g., interaction between UI and database, or between different pages).  

### 1.3 Acceptance Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify that the app meets business requirements and works as expected from the user's perspective.  
- **Automated/Manual**: Combination of automated and manual testing  
- **Tools**: Cypress, Selenium for automated testing; manual testing by the QA team.  
- **Scope**: Ensure all functional requirements are met (e.g., navigation between pages, sign-in process, order placement).

## 2. Testing Process

### 2.1 Who Will Test?
- **Unit Tests**: Developers  
- **Integration Tests**: Developers  
- **Acceptance Tests**: QA team (manual testing); QA team will also handle automated acceptance testing if needed.  
- **Performance and Load Tests**: QA team/DevOps team  

### 2.2 When Will Tests Be Executed?
#### Unit and Integration Tests:
- Before each pull request (PR) is merged into the main branch.  
- Automated tests will run through the CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions.  

#### Acceptance Tests:
- After each milestone is completed and before code is deployed to production.  
- Manual acceptance testing will be performed after each feature is merged into the main branch.  

#### Performance and Load Tests:
- After major releases or changes that could impact app performance.  
- Periodically as the app scales or to validate new features under load.

## 3. Test Environments

### 3.1 Location of Code Under Test
- Code will be tested on the development environment (local machines) for unit tests.  
- Code will also be tested on staging and production environments for acceptance, performance, and load tests.  
- The staging environment will closely mirror the production environment.  

---

## 4. Failure Protocol

### 4.1 How to Report a Bug
**Tester Responsibility**:  
- If a test fails, the tester must gather relevant details (steps to reproduce, logs, screenshots, etc.) and report the issue.  
- The tester will open an issue in GitHub Issues or a similar issue tracker.  
- The issue should include:  
  - A clear title  
  - A detailed description  
  - A priority level (Critical, Major, Minor)  
  - Relevant attachments (e.g., logs, screenshots, videos)  

### 4.2 Bug Triage
- **Project Manager/Team Lead** will review the bug report and assign a priority:  
  - **Critical**: Blocks a core feature of the app.  
  - **Major**: Impacts a significant feature but has workarounds.  
  - **Minor**: Cosmetic or low-impact issue.  
- **Developer Assignment**: The issue will be assigned to the relevant developer for resolution.  

### 4.3 Fixing the Bug
- The assigned developer will reproduce the issue locally and work on the fix.  
- Once fixed, the developer will submit a pull request with the changes.  
- The changes will go through unit testing and integration testing again to verify that the bug is resolved and no new issues are introduced.  

### 4.4 Re-testing
- The tester will verify the fix by rerunning the failed tests to confirm the issue is resolved.  
- The issue will be marked as closed once verified.
