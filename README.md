## Mission Statement  
Striving to provide fast, healthy, and affordable food options to under-resourced neighborhoods impacted by food inequities.

## Problem Statement  
In under-resourced neighborhoods, especially those predominantly made up of Black, Brown, and immigrant families, access to fresh, affordable, and nutritious food is severely limited not due to a lack of desire or awareness, but because of systemic racial and economic inequities (Burrell, 2022). Estimates indicate that 18.8 million people, or 6.1 percent of the U.S. population, reside in a food desert (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] 2022). This issue, more accurately described as food apartheid rather than "food deserts," impacts individuals’ bodies, minds, and futures. Students affected by food apartheid often feel tired, sick, or distracted in class due to low-quality school meals or limited healthy options at home (Burrell, 2022) Over time, these conditions contribute to chronic health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure.

Structural inequities are further emphasized by research from the University of Michigan, which shows that communities of color—even those with similar poverty rates as white neighborhoods—face significantly fewer supermarkets and a higher concentration of fast food outlets, exacerbating poor health outcomes (Walker et al., 2023). Food-insecure adults and children also have higher rates of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and are at high risk for chronic diseases (Chilton, 2012) .With 1 in 3 people globally experiencing severe food insecurity (United Nations, 2023), the urgency to act is clear.

At the same time, food waste remains a massive and often overlooked issue in the U.S., particularly among large companies and organizations within the food supply chain. According to the USDA, 30-40% of the U.S. food supply, around 133 billion pounds, is wasted each year, equating to over $161 billion in losses (USDA, 2023). The environmental toll is equally staggering: food waste is the largest contributor to landfill mass and methane emissions, a greenhouse gas more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 2023).

Large-scale food waste is driven by overproduction, cosmetic standards, and logistical inefficiencies in corporate and institutional systems. Supermarkets, restaurants, and food distributors often discard surplus edible food due to minor imperfections, inventory turnover, or misaligned demand forecasting. While some organizations donate leftovers, the infrastructure and incentives to do so effectively are lacking. In fact, ReFED reported that in 2023 alone, food waste accounted for $338 billion in lost food value (ReFED, 2023).

Existing solutions such as food waste reduction apps like Too Good To Go, meal planning tools, government assistance programs, and community gardens have made strides in addressing either food insecurity or food waste, but they fall short of fully resolving the problem, particularly in under-resourced communities impacted by food apartheid. Apps like Too Good To Go successfully reduce food waste and offer discounted meals, yet they often operate in more affluent or urban areas with dense commercial activity, limiting accessibility for marginalized neighborhoods (Vo-Thanh et al., 2021). Furthermore, despite the availability of government programs such as SNAP and food banks, food insecurity remains a widespread issue. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (2023), approximately 1 in 20 people in the United States still experience food insecurity, suggesting that existing interventions do not sufficiently address the structural and systemic barriers these communities face.

These dual challenges, limited food access and widespread food waste, are deeply connected. While some communities lack basic food access, others see organizations discarding surplus food due to systemic inefficiencies and rigid supply systems. Team Connecting seeks to address both crises by designing equitable, user-centered solutions that improve food access in marginalized communities while reducing organizational and systemic food waste.
